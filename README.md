# Dominic Beesley’s 3rd Milestone Project

The aim of this project is to build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain, using all the technologies that I've learned about so far from Code Institute. 

To do this, I’ve created a website for users to register, submit book reviews, and view book reviews made by other users. 

The project can be found at [http://datacentricbooks.herokuapp.com/]( http://datacentricbooks.herokuapp.com/)

## UX <hr>

![Website on different devices](assets/images/amiresponsive.png)

My website is a collection of user-submitted book reviews.

The goal of the website is for users to be able to find new books to read by reading book reviews, while at the same time posting their own book reviews on the website, which may help future visitors to the site. In this aim, it’s similar to websites such as Goodreads or Shelfari.

The website is also interactive, in that users can post their own reviews, and afterwards, if any details on it need to be changed, they can edit and update them, or even delete their review and remove the book from the website completely.

A wireframe for the website can be found [here](…).
